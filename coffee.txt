Before we start talking about coffee, we must understand what makes us feel tired.
Our body has the ability to transmit energy to the cell through ATP (adenosine triphosphate) molecules.
They're made of the glucose we eat.
These molecules contain three phosphates.
Let's pretend you have a gun with three bullets.
Every time you need energy for exercise, for example, this gun starts shooting energy at protein molecules and makes them do their job.
When there are no bullets in the gun, ATP becomes an adenosine molecule.
We have adenosine receptors in our bodies.
These receptors pick up adenosine and send a signal to our brain that we are tired and need new energy.
The more adenosine molecules the receptors catch, the more you feel tired and sleepy.

Now we can talk about coffee and caffeine.
Caffeine molecules look like adenosine, but only for adenosine receptors.
Inside, they're different.
Adenosine receptors catch caffeine, so a cup of coffee fills all the adenosine receptors in the body.
And until the adenosine receptors break down the caffeine molecules, they can't catch adenosine.
In an hour all the adenosine molecules that were in the blood will be caught by the receptors, and we will feel much more tired.
Caffeine doesn't bring energy, it's a lie in our brain that we're not tired.

But what's wrong with that?
The brain doesn't have the latest information, and the body works for wear and tear.
If someone drinks coffee regularly, their body will create more adenosine receptors (because they want relevant information from the body).
And that's not good.
You will feel tired faster than other people with fewer adenosine receptors.

I don't want to lie to my brain.
