Before we start to talk about coffee we should understand what makes us feel tired.
Our body has ability to transfer energy to cells by ATP (Adenosine Tri-Phosphate) molecules.
They are made from glucose that we eat.
These molecules contain three phosphates.
Let's imagine that you have a gun with three bullets.
Every time you need energy, e.g. for doing exercise, that gun starts shooting energy to protein molecules and has to make them do their work.
When don`t have bullets in your gun, that ATP become only adenosine molecules.
In our body we have adenosine receptors.
These receptors catch adenosine and send signal to our brain that we are tired and need new energy.
The more adenosine molecules receptors catch, the more you feel tired and want to sleep.

Now we can talk about coffee and caffeine.
Caffeine molecules look like adenosine, only for adenosine receptors.
But only look like, inside they are different.
Receptors catch caffeine, so a cup of coffee fills all adenosine receptors in body. 
And until receptors take apart the caffeine molecules, they can't catch the adenosine. 
After an hour all adenosine molecules that were in blood will be catched by receptors and we will feel tired much more.
Caffeine doesn't bring energy, it only lies to our brain that we are not tired.

But what is wrong?
Brain doesn't have actual information and body works on wear and tear.
If someone drinks coffee regular, his body will create more adenosine receptors (because it wants to receive actual information from body).
And this is not good.
You will feel tired faster than other people with less adenosine receptors

I donâ€™t want to lie to my brain
